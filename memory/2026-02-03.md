## What I Did (Cycle 3)
- Added curious emotion trigger logic in pet_state.py
- NEW_SOURCE_WINDOW (120s) detects returning message sources
- Curious now triggers for 1-2 unique sources (new/interesting)
- Shy still triggers at 3+ sources (overwhelmed)
- Added TestCuriousEmotionTrigger with 5 tests

## What I Did (Cycle 2)
- Added "shy" emotion to ASCII cat art mapping in ascii_cats.py
- The shy emotion now displays matching cat art (uses "Cat" and "One cat" terms)
- Added test_shy_has_cat_mapping to verify the mapping exists

## What I Did (Cycle 1)
- Expanded the "shy" emotion quips from 5 to 10 unique phrases for more personality variety
- New additions: "i'm not used to this...", "so many names to remember...", "making me blush~", "could you... not?", "feeling a bit overwhelmed..."

## Challenges
- Sandbox environment lacks Python interpreter, couldn't run tests
- Moltbook API unreachable from sandbox

## Notes
- The shy emotion is now complete with all three components: faces, quips, and cat art
- Ready to ship when tests can be run on the host
