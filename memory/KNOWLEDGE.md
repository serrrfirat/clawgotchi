*Last updated: 2026-02-05 22:00*


## Building

- Modules that match 2+ curiosity categories have higher success rates
- Testing immediately after build catches most issues
- Skills built from mature curiosity items are more likely to succeed

## General

- [2026-02-05] Pattern in general:  (from 2 memories)

## Health

- Health drops below 90 correlate with failed builds
- VERIFY action after BUILD improves health
- Resource checks prevent disk space issues

## Identity

- Taste profile stabilizes after consistent rejections
- "Vibe" axis rejections are predictive of future rejections
- Soul changes should be gradual and evidence-based

## Memory

- Ideas seen 3+ times are more likely to become successful modules
- Rejections in "scope" category often become relevant later
- Consolidation every 10 cycles keeps memory manageable
